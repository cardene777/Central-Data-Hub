## Wave 4


・Updating documentation



The documentation was complex and difficult to understand.

It has therefore been revised to make it easier to understand by adding diagrams and writing the content in as much detail as possible.

Linked to 'CDN', a Domain Name Service on the CROSSVALUE Chain.

CDNs can be minted from the CDH.

However, as the Domain Name cannot currently be obtained from the address in the CDN contract, we will implement its acquisition and display in the next Wave.

(We have contacted the CDN developer to address this.)

This will allow us to give a unique name to the address that manages the CDH, making the address more manageable and secure.
