・Metadata updates.

A function to update CDH metadata is implemented.

Mainly attribute data can be added.

Have each user's data managed as a single file in each Dapps and BCG.

You can register each Dapps or BCG with a unique number in the CDH for each Dapps or BCG and add the URL of that data to the CDH metadata with that value as the key.

The video is below.
